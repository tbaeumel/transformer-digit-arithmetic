### Data and Code for ARR Submission 'Modular Arithmetic: Language Models Solve Math Digit by Digit'

This repository contains an .ipynb script to reproduce the main finding presented in the paper: Through intervention on MLP subspaces that correspond to digit-position-specific circuits only the result digit corresponding to the intervened on digit position is affected.  

Details are in the *Digit_Circuit_Intervention.ipynb* script. 


In addition, we provide full results for the qualitative analysis of digit-position heuristics presented in Section 5 of the paper.
